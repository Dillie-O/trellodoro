		<h2>How it Works</h2>
		
		<p>
			The beauty is in the simplicity.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			First, connect to your Trello account. Then select a card that has been
			assigned to you that you want to work on. Then click the "Go" button.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This will open up the timer. Then click the "Start" button. The timer will
			give you a 25 minute countdown and ring when time is up. It will immediately
			jump into a 5 minute break timer for you.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Once your break is up (or anytime really). Click the "Pomodoro" button. This
			will add a sticker to your card in Trello (it shows up almost immediately!).
			Each sticker is offset, so you can see how many pomodoros you've completed.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			When you're ready to start on another task. Close the timer, select a new
			card from the drop down list, and click the "Go" button again!

		<h2>Why Trellodoro?</h2>
		
		<p>
			I've been on a quest to make the <a href="http://personalkanban.com" _target="_blank"></a> and the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">Pomodoro Technique</a> work for my day to
			day programming needs. I've tried <a href="http://dillieodigital.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/kanned-tomatoes-a-kanban-pomodoro-way-of-getting-things-done/" target="_blank">not once</a>, 
			but <a href="http://dillieodigital.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/kanned-tomatoes-an-update/" target="_blank">two times</a> to
			make things work and I think I'm finally making progres..
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Both times, I kept coming back to <a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a> as
			the place where I like to keep my personal kanban board. However, I didn't
			have a way to store my Pomodoro iterations on the cards without modifying
			descriptions, and losing a bit of time along the way.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			However, thanks to the Trello API, this can now be done easily through the use
			of Trello's "stickers" feature. One clock sticker indicates one "pomodoro" completed.
			I can easily update the cards from within my own timer and move on to the next.

		<h2>Customization</h2>
		
		<p>
			Do you need a longer or shorter pomodoro period? Simply change the values in
			the "Configure Pomodoro Timer" section to meet your needs before clicking the
			"Go" button. If you reset your timer, it'll remember these values.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Moving forward, I'm looking to add some additional customziations depending
			on need. Maybe you want some different stickers? Random stickers? Custom stickers?
			I'll see what I can do. Check out the 
			<a href="https://trello.com/b/1UhfdPHs/trellodoro" _target="blank">Trellodoro Trello Board</a> and
			provide your feedback.
